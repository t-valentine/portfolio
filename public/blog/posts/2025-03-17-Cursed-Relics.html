          <h2>Cursed Relics Post-Mortem</h2>

          <h3>What is Cursed Relics?</h3>
          <p>
            Cursed Relics is a drawing challenge from ARTIST. You can find the
            2024 prompt list here: LINK.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to draw a little introductory 4 page comic, then do
            illustrations for the remaining prompts and <em>maybe</em> draw a
            comic as the 'end'. It was very much originally planned as a series
            of illustrations. The 'final' work is 4 pages of illustrations and
            29 pages of comics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Somewhere along the way (mid October), I began to want to draw more
            comics and tell a real, coherent story rather than random vignettes.
            In addition to this, I thought it would be run to update the comic
            bi-weekly as a short form webcomic. I've always loved webcomics and
            have been interested in them as a medium; this seemed like a fun way
            to try my hand at it without overcommitting.
          </p>
          <h3>How Was It?</h3>
          <p style="font-size: x-large">Fun!!!</p>
          <p>
            I hosted the comic on this site using Rarebit. I used an edited
            GitHub action to autodeploy updates twice a week (which allowed me
            to "queue" one page at a time rather than needing to update manually
            every day). I kind of wish I'd worked a little more and found a way
            to queue multiple pages though. (Admittedly, this is mostly a me
            problem. I only have a desktop computer and had to leave my house
            for a week, so I couldn't code or queue a new page since I didn't
            have a computer.)
          </p>
          <h3>What Did I Learn?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span style="font-size: x-large">Planning is important</span>
              <br />
              <span style="font-size: small"
                >(I knew I was underplanning the comic, but there's a lot more
                to planning besides 'plot' and 'thumbnails'.)</span
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              B&W comics are hard to keep from looking muddled (color is easier
              for my brain I guess)
            </li>
            <li>
              I really need a 2 month buffer (technically I need a 1 month
              buffer and then a 1 month buffer for my buffer)
            </li>
            <li>
              If I want to draw stuff besides the comic, my (current) limit is 1
              page a week
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Anything else?</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a bit torn between hosting my comic somewhere like Comic Fury,
            or continuing to use my own free website with Rarebit. I'll probably
            play around with Comic Fury a bit. I do feel like Rarebit is super
            useful and free and totally up to me to customize, BUT. It's really
            hard for me to have to be at my desk to update. Also, I really like
            the idea of being able to bulk upload and schedule pages.
