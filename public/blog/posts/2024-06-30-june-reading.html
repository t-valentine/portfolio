          <h2>June Reading</h2>
          <time id="post-date"></time>
          <p>
            I read a lot in June because my yearly reading goal is 30 books and
            I was only at 11 at the beginning of the month. I defeated my demons
            and read 3 "short" books in a row. I have problems with only reading
            short books because I have yet to kill the elitist in my head.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had a much better time reading than last month, where I endured a
            terrible novel, <em>The Kaiju Preservation Society</em>. That novel
            might be fine but I don't want to read a Marvel movie. I especially
            don't want to read a Marvel movie if I thought it would have more
            substance because it was fucking nominated for a Hugo and won a
            Locus. Was 2023 that bad a year of scifi? Whatever, I refuse to be
            any more negative about something ultimately harmless.

            Not listed below- I also read the first 2 volumes of Tomie and the
            entirety of Uzumaki. (Because

            they're manga, not books.

          <p>
            This is a re-read. AND I finished reading it before the
            <a
              href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/laika-piranesi-travis-knight-susanna-clarke-1236042093/"

              >Laika announcement!
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            I think Susanna Clark is a fucking genius and her two novels are
            both some of the greatest written work in the human language. I
            usually recommend people read <em>Piranesi</em> because it's a
            shorter novel (at under 300 pages). Versus
            <em>Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell</em> (800 pages).
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Piranesi</em> is about a man who lives in an empty labyrinth of
            rooms and statues that's flooded periodically by a nearby sea. He
            only knows of one other person and when the existence of a third
            living person is revealed, it threatens the peace and science he's
            established in his home.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's very dreamy and thoughtful and a bit poetic. Susanna Clarke has
            such strong prose and the subject of the novel is perfect for that.

          <h3 id="2">#13: <em>Camp Damascus</em> by Chuck Tingle</h3>
          <p>
            Despite being online for the rise in popularity of Chuck Tingle, I'd
            never read any of his work. (I just checked, his first book was
            published in 2014 and I've been on Tumblr since 2012, so my online
            presence does predate his.)
          </p>
          <p>
            I really enjoyed this book and thought it was a really interesting
            take on the subject (religious cults and conversion camps). The
            effectiveness of the horror elements in this novel were definitely
            effected by: me being a quick reader (which tends to undercut a lot
            of tension in books because I just zip right along) and me reading
            through Tomie chapters at the same time. It's not fair to say Chuck
            Tingle's book wasn't horror enough when I was also reading Junji Ito
            at the same time. I do think the novel has very good tension, clear
            stakes, and a good spooky atmosphere. Whether or not it's actually
            scary can be up to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did enjoy the novel. It's about a girl in a religious cult who
            begins seeing a demon that seems to draw a connection between her
            and a nearby conversion camp- even though she's not gay and has
            never attended. Chuck Tingle writes unknown/new same sex attraction
            perfectly.
          </p>
          <h3 id="3">#14: <em>The Night Guest</em> by Fiona McFarlane</h3>
          <p>
            I received this book as part of a Discord Secret Santa and only got
            around to reading it this month. I check out a lot of things from
            the library (like
            <em>Piranesi</em> and <em>Camp Damascus</em>) and tend to put off
            books I own until I'm out of library books. This is a slightly
            random process because I put a lot of books on hold and when they're
            available is not up to me, but the great Chicago Library system.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is described as a psychological thriller but you should
            know going into the novel that it's a very slow burn. It's terrific,
            like a trap. You always have an idea of what's happening, but by the
            time it's obvious it's too late.
          </p>
          <p>
            The novel is about an old woman named Ruth who lives alone in her
            New South Wales beach house. She imagines (maybe?) a tiger in her
            home and the next day a woman from the government shows up to give
            her assistance. Through the course of the book, Ruth reminisces
            about her time living with Christian missionary parents in Fuji.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book is also a bit sad and makes you think about your older
            relatives. A blurb on the back of my copy says something like
            "reminds you to call your mom". Which is true.
          </p>
          <h3 id="4">#15: <em>Monstrilio</em> by Gerardo Sámano Córdova</h3>
          <p>
            Kind of a lot of horror this month. But! I really enjoyed this, it
            may end up being one of my favorite books for the whole year.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is about a couple that loses a child, and then some
            fallout from that when the lung Magos (the mother) feeds grows into
            a little furry monster. It's a really interesting book on grief and
            belonging. It's also worth noting that a majority of characters in
            the book are Mexican (or at least in the case of the monster, born
            in Mexico City). There are also a lot of LGBT characters. There's
            probably a lot of say about those themes and the theme of the work
            as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of my thoughts about the book center around the ending, so I
            find it hard to write a lot here without spoiling anything. Instead,
            I will say I do enjoy well-written horror books about parental
            grief. I'm sensitive and should probably enjoy these kinds of works
            before I have a kid and it makes me too sad to think/red about your
            children dying.
