          <h1>Why Webp?</h1>
          <time id="post-date"></time>
          <p>
            I used WebP as the image file on my site! This file type has a kind
            of bad rap (because it's annoying to download), but I like using it
            on my website. There's actually a very simple answer...
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 2em">
            The files are smaller than anything else!!!
          </p>
          <p>
            When you're making your own website, size of images can matter a
            lot. It also effects loading time for your readers.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the webp image for my 'January' illustration is 445.5
            kB. The same file on my computer stored as a png is
            <span style="font-weight: 800">6.2 MB</span>. 6.2MB is 6,200 kB, for
            reference. I didn't resize the image, all I did was convert it to
            WebP and I saved about 5,700 kB.
          </p>
          <h2>Isn't it annoying to convert all your stuff?</h2>
          <p>
            It used to be! But I wrote a bash program to convert files a little
            more quickly.
          </p>
          <textarea name="link" cols="NUMBER" rows="6" style="width: 100%">
read -p "File name w/type: " file
fileArr=(${file//./ })
cwebp $file -o ${fileArr[0]}.webp
rm $file
echo "Converted "$file" to "${fileArr[0]}".webp"
          </textarea>
          <p>
            So if I open my terminal in a folder with my drawings and that file,
            I can run `bash convertfile.sh`, type in the file I want to convert
            and it's converted! Honestly, if I didn't have this then I would be
            too lazy to use WebP 100%.
          </p>
