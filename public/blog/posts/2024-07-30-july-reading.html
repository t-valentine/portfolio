            Less books than last month, but I think an equal number of pages.
            For what it's worth. I believe this was also an All Horror Month.
            I'm not entirely sure if
            <strong>Under the Pendulum Sun</strong> counts 100% as horror.

          <h1>'Between Two Fires' is the best book I've read this year!</h1>
          <p>
            If you pick up 1 book I write about in these blogs, please make it
            that book. My boyfriend saw it recommended somewhere and checked out
            the audiobook, then told me about it. Read it!

          <h3 id="1">#16: <em>The Reaping</em> by Bernard Taylor</h3>
          <p>
            I started this blog at the end of May and only started writing book
            entires in June. As a result, I've never written on any of the
            'Paperbacks from Hell.' <strong>Paperbacks from Hell</strong> is an
            illustration heavy book by Grady Hendrix about the history of
            paperback horror. There's a strong emphasis on the cover art done
            for the novels. After that book was published, 21 old horror books
            were re-published with their original painted covers. I read a
            couple last year because I like old cheesy horror and read
            <strong>The Nest</strong> in January.
            <strong>The Reaping</strong> is another one of the republished
            books.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book is about a widower who owns an art supplies shop and is
            encouraged by a girlfriend to enter his paintings into a local art
            show. After the show, he's approached by a woman looking to have a
            portrait made of her employer's niece. He goes to the employer's
            estate for a week or two to paint the portrait and creepy things
            ensue.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a "slow" book in terms of revealing itself but the character
            writing and tension is written so well. Because I'm kind of familiar
            with witchcraft-related superstitions, I was able to figure out the
            twist about halfway through the book. This did <em>not</em> impact
            by enjoyment of the book. I really enjoyed it and will be seeking
            out some of the other things Bernard Taylor wrote.
          </p>
          <h3 id="2">#17: <em>Under the Pendulum Sun</em> by Jeannette Ng</h3>
          <p>
            The copy I got from the library had the "SciFi" sticker on the
            spine, however this novel is a capital G fantasy Gothic novel. I
            found this book from a tumblr post that urged enjoyers of gothic
            fiction to check out this book.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is impossible to look up anything about this book without finding
            (what I believe to be) a major spoiler of the work. It's an adult
            gothic work and I think if you are comfortable with similar works,
            then you won't be bothered. The book is not terribly graphic in the
            physicality of the spoiler and I believe it's used very effectively
            in the book.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story takes place in an alternate past, where the British empire
            found the land of the Fae and began trade with the fae. As with all
            things relating to empires, they also begun sending Christian
            missionaries. The story follows Catherine, a woman who's missionary
            brother has not written her in several months. She journeys to
            Arcadia (land of the Fae) to find him. She succeeds in the first
            third of the book, and the remainder of the book is about a Fairy
            Queen's visit and Catherine's determination to discover truth's
            about the (creepy) estate she and her brother now live in.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't believe the book completely comes together, and I think
            there are some checks the author doesn't cash. However, the main
            conflict is very convincingly written and the world building is
            really interesting. I would wholeheartedly recommend this book. It's
            also the author's first novel and a really great first novel. I'll
            be interested to see what Jeannette Ng publishes next.
          </p>
          <p>
            P.S. I was raised Christian, so I'm familiar with the biblical
            references in the book. I have no idea how this book would read to
            someone without background in Christian theology and stories. The
            knowledge isn't mandatory to understand and enjoy the book, but I
            think it may change how you engage with it.

            #18: <em>Between Two Fires</em> by Christopher Buehlman
          </h3>
          <p>
            This book did make me cry at the end and I ordered a copy for my
            home library before getting halfway through the book. It's a
            terrific book and hits one of my soft points, which is why I cried.
          </p>
          <p>
            The premise of the book is pretty simple: what if the Black Plague
            was actually the forces of Hell trying to goad God into another holy
            war? And what if, not content with the suffering the plague alone
            created, demons also began roaming the earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems like I would have a similiar note for this that I wrote for
            <strong>Under the Pendulum Sun</strong> and Christianity, but I
            don't. While this book is really more about religion (seeing as it's
            literal demons causing the problems), I think it's the parts of
            Christianity that are very mainstream in American culture. It's much
            more well thought out than something like Supernatural, but I think
            it's at a similar level of necessary knowledge to engage with the
            piece.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book follows a knight, a priest, and a young girl as they travel
            through Europe. The girl (Delphine) is convinced that they need to
            travel a certain path and it's a bit of a road trip book in that
            regard. The book is slightly episodic, but I didn't find it grating
            or repetitive. Like a good monster of the week show, each "episode"
            reveals something new about the characters and the nature of their
            world. I briefly mentioned it up top, but this is a horror novel and
            is sufficiently creepy and graphically violent. It's a really
            terrific description of hell and demons.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book also <em>does</em> have a gay character that's
            well-written and appropriate for the time frame, but also written
            very lovingly. There's homophobia, but it doesn't feel mean.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once again, I cried at the end. I don't think I can even do a good
            job describing this book. It's maybe the best book I've read this
            year.
