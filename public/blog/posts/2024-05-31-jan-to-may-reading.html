          <h2>January to May Reading</h2>
          <time id="post-date"></time>
          <p>
            I started this blog in June and realized that means the books I read
            for the first half of the year aren't recorded here. I'm writing
            this in September, but have back-dated the blog post so it will show
            up in the 'right' chronological order. Below is a list of the books
            I read in January through May. Asterisks (*) mean I really enjoyed
            the work.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><em>The Nest</em> by Gregory A. Douglas</li>
            <li><em>Paperbacks from Hell</em> by Grady Hendrix</li>
            <li><em>Out There Screaming</em> (anthology work)</li>
            <li><em>Our Hideous Progeny</em> by C.E. McGill *</li>
            <li><em>Foundation</em> by Isaac Asimov</li>
            <li><em>What Feasts at Night</em> by T. Kingfisher</li>
            <li><em>Poor Things</em> by Alasdair Gray *</li>
            <li><em>Going Postal</em> by Terry Pratchett</li>
            <li><em>Foundation and Empire</em> by Isaac Asimov</li>
            <li>
              <em>The Kaiju Preservation Society</em> by John Scalzi (I actually
              HATED this)
            </li>
            <li><em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em> by Ray Bradbury *</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            My goal for the year is 30 books, so with only 11 at the end of May,
            you can see why I picked up the pace in June, July, and August.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also worth nothing is that <em>Going Postal</em> was my only
            re-read.
