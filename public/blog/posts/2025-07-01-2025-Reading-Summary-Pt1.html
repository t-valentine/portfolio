          <p>
            It feels like the first half of the year really encapsulates my
            reading habits: scifi, horror, and becoming obsessed with finishing
            a children's book series. It was hard for me as a kid to read an
            entire series because I didn't have the patience to wait for the
            next book to become available. I would often skip books and get
            confused and stop reading, or get bored waiting and forget about the
            series altogether.
          </p>
          <p>
            In late May, my husband and I watched the beautiful but poorly
            written Guardians of Ga'Hoole movie. This movie attempts to adapt
            the first 3 books in the series, but does so in a way that flattens
            all characters and confuses plot twists from later in the series.
            This is pretty typical of children's book adaptations in the
            mid-2010s, from what I remember.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was curious about what the movie did wrong, so I started reading
            the books. By god, there's 16 of them. The author, Kathryn Lasky,
            published 15 books from 2003 to 2008, only going back to add one
            more book to the series in 2013 which is pretty impressive. I have a
            deep dislike for artists who continue going back to "finished"
            series to make money and a huge amount of respect for any creator
            willing to really finish a popular work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't read a ton of children's literature, so I don't feel I'm
            particularly qualified to write on how good or bad the series is.
            I'm enjoying it and I think Lasky does a good job managing the
            increasing cast of characters. There are a lot of owls in this book
            and while some are a bit flat, overall they're well-characterized.
          </p>
          <p>
            The books are also a bit silly and have phrases like "bingle juice"
            and "sprink on your spronk." I enjoy reading sentences full of made
            up lore words to rage bait my husband.
          </p>
          <p>Okay, enough Owl Talk.</p>
          <p>
            I continue to read along with
            <a href="https://rangedtouch.com/shelved-by-genre/"
              >Shelved by Genre</a
            >, who finished a William Gibson unit and began a post-apocalypse
            unit. I read (and enjoyed) Dune and will probably devote some time
            to reading the entire series, eventually. I read 'Victorian Psycho'
            and 'Hungerstone' which were interesting but a bit obvious to me,
            but I wonder if that's based on reading a lot of similar work or if
            they're actually not that deep.

          <h3>5 Books I Particularly Enjoyed, in No Specific Order:</h3>
          <p>(That I haven't mentioned already)</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: 800">Becoming Kin</span> Really good
              book on how to be a better ally for indigenous people and
              decolonizing your thinking. Even if you won't read this, you
              should
              <a href="http://native-lands.ca/">see whose land you live on</a>
              and think about that.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: 800">The Witchstone</span> I thought one
              of the main characters was annoying and not very charming, but
              then he won me over at the very end in such a spectacular way that
              I still think fondly of him.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: 800">The Familiar</span> Extremely cool
              setting and a straight pairing I cared about (rare)
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: 800">The Buffalo Hunter Hunter</span>
              Stephen Graham Jones does it again. I also think if you're posting
              online how cool the Choctaw are in Sinners, you're morally
              required to read this.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span style="font-weight: 800">Slewfoot</span> Great book with
              BEAUTIFUL illustrations done by the author. My husband bought it
              and told me to read it, so it's also a Zeke Recommendation.
            </li>
          </ul>
