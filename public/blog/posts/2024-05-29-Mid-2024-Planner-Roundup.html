          <h2>Mid-2024 Planner Roundup</h2>
          <time id="post-date"></time>

          <p>
            It's basically June, which is the 6th month. It's almost halfway
            through the year, so I feel like it's a good time to do a
            retrospective on my planner. And stationary.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2023, I made the incredibly hard decision to stop using the
            <a href="https://www.mossery.co/" target="_blank">Mossery planner</a
            >. Zeke got me one several years ago and I'd used one for about 3
            years. The conceit of the planner is simple: you buy a cover, then
            every year buy inserts. Mossery has really good inserts- there's
            multiple kinds of planners (horizontal, vertical, dated, and
            undated) and notebooks/sketchbooks you can choose to use too. The
            inserts (called refills on the site) aren't too expensive either.
            The combo of inserts I like is under $30 (two light refills for the
            halves of the year and a grid notebook), which is really reasonable.
          </p>

          <p>
            HOWEVER. Mossery is a Malaysian-based company. For the US, you have
            to reach a $90 minimum purchase for free shipping. Without free
            shipping, shipping is $25-ish dollars. That means for me, a yearly
            refill is a $50 purchase. I don't remember if shipping was always
            that pricy and I'd gaslit myself into being fine with that, or if it
            used to be cheaper.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unable to make myself spend $50 on a planner, I turned to
            alternatives. (Sidebar: I think $50 is ok to spend on a planner if
            you really like it. However, this isn't even a whole planner. It's
            inserts for a cover you already own.) I landed on the
            <strong>Hobonichi Techo Weeks MEGA</strong>. This planner was $35 on
            Jetpens. (and Jetpens gives free shipping on orders over $35!)
          </p>

          <h3 id="techno">The Techno Weeks</h3>
          <p>
            As you can tell from the picture above, the Techno Weeks is a slim,
            compact planner. It's 7.4" by 3.7" and I specifically bought the
            "MEGA" version which has 200 graph pages in the back, versus the 73
            additional pages in the regular version. I really like the format of
            "left page has the week, right page is blank" so this was perfect
            for me. I also have very neat, small handwriting.
          </p>

          <p>
            (In grad school, I used the regular Hobonichi Techno and really
            liked it, so if you have a more intense schedule and/or want
            something even smaller, that may be a good alternative for you.)

          <h4>Pros and Cons</h4>
          Pros
          <ul>
            <li>Small size that fits perfectly on my desk and in bags</li>
            <li>Good weekly layout</li>
            <li>
              Monthly layouts in the front of the planner have lots of space for
              writing future plans
            </li>
            <li>Option to have lots of extra pages in the back</li>
            <li><em>Two</em> built-in bookmarks</li>
          </ul>
          Cons
          <ul>
            <li>
              No elastic to keep it shut- mine is getting pretty thick since I
              use washi tape and stickers on my weekly spreads. Having a built
              in closure or elastic would be nice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Size- I know I listed this in pros. But I think it could be a con
              for some people.
            </li>
            <li>
              Thin Paper - this doesn't bother <em>me</em>, but since the paper
              is so thin there's often some bleed through. I actually like this
              in a notebook/planner and I've found it's not too bad even with
              "heavier" pens. But if bleed through bothers you, there are
              planners with thicker pages.
