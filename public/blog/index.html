          <h1>My blog!</h1>
          <p>
            My blog is now part of this website! This page has a list of the
            <a href="#recent"> all posts</a> on the side (or bottom if you're on
            a phone). I'll also have blog 'snippets' post directly below this
            intro for things that I think are too small for their own blog post.

          <h3>Adding Arrows to External Links (05-15-25)</h3>
          <p>
            I wanted to add arrows to all external links on this because I think
            it looks nice and it makes it clear which links are external links.
            Below is the code I used:
          </p>
          <textarea name="link" cols="NUMBER" rows="4" style="width: 100%">
a[href^="http"]:where(:not(:has(img), [href*="domain.tld/"]))::after {
  content: "â†—";
}
</textarea
          >
          <p>
            If you're googling, you'll see that mine has an `:has(img)` in the
            'not' to exclude my image links. I thought the arrow after my images
            (like the buttons on the comics page) looked goofy.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could replace the arrow with anything you'd like or even replace
            it with an image. I didn't want to mess around with that and thought
            a simple arrow was fine.
          </p>
