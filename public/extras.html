      <h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
      <p>This is just kind of a catch-all, fun page. There's webcomics I read, there's links to fonts (and other stuff) I use
        when I make websites and art, there's links to other websites, blah blah blah. Have fun, and if there's something you wish 
        I'd include on this page, let me know!
      </p>
      <h2>Reading List</h2>
      <h3>Books</h3>
      <p>I read a lot. I read 50 books in 2022. Since then, I'm taking it slow and am just reading one or two books a month.
        I like Scifi/Fantasy, anything weird, and (most of all) a huge terrible tome to slog through. I've actually spent 4 years trying to 
        read <cite>Moby Dick</cite>, at this point it feels like finishing it may result in my untimely death.
        Currently I'm reading <cite>The Book of the New Sun</cite> by Gene Wolfe for the first time. I'm sure I will immediately reread it upon finishing 
        the final book, it seems like that kind of series.
        <p><strong>Books I've Read in 2023:</strong></p>
        <div class="book-list">
          <p style="margin-top:0px;"><cite>The Book of Eels: Our Enduring Fascination with the Most Mysterious Creature in the Natural World</cite> by Patrik Svensson</p>
          <p><cite>The Phantom Tollbooth</cite> by Norton Juster</p>
          <p><cite>The Shadow of the Torturer</cite> by Gene Wolfe</p>
        </div>
      </p>
      <h3>Webcomics</h3>
      <p>I also read webcomics! I'm trying to read more and have a big list of comics I want to start reading. I'm only
        putting comics I'm up to date with on this list, so more will crop up as I catch up with other works.
