        <p>I'm Tobi Valentine, a queer person who enjoys making art. I use he/him pronouns.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I like to draw full illustrations and enjoy creating short-form comics. One day I'd love to do a longer webcomic. I'm available to for personal and commercial
            work, although I do have a different full time job. That full time job is as a Software Developer- I coded this website and have a 
            <a href="https://github.com/t-valentine" target="_blank" class="formatted-link">github portfolio</a> as well. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>In addition to making stuff I also like to read, hike, putter around in my garden, hang out with my pets, and play TTRPGs with friends.
            (I'm trying to read 50 books in 2022, it was a terrible mistake. Just read for readings sake 
            don't try to reach any metric.)
        </p>
