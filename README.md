# Portfolio

A website for me to post art and comics I draw. It can be viewed on [neocities](https://h0neymice.neocities.org).

Thank you to [Rarebit](https://rarebit.neocities.org/) for creating an easy to use template for posting comics. This portfolio uses a heavily modified version of their code.

Additional thank you to [sqvrltastic](https://sqvrltastic.github.io/blog/full-guide-to-rss.html) for the very clear RSS tutorial. Without the tutorial, the RSS feed would be in shambles.
